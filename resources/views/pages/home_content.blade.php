		Medicine Corner was a programme of cultural activity in India from Wellcome Collection, the public cultural venue in London of the Wellcome Trust. It ran from January 2015 to the end of March 2016.
		From the ancient and continuously evolving knowledge systems of Ayurveda and Unani to cutting-edge advances in modern surgery, Indian medicine is as richly diverse as Indian civilization itself. In homes and villages, and on the teeming streets of India’s great cities, healing practices are a pervasive feature of everyday life.
		Health commerce is integral to India’s vast street economy in which lay healers sell an astonishing range of goods and services. These co- exist, often uneasily, with the elite biomedical hospitals in which India now conducts some of the world’s most advanced medical research and development.
		Medicine Corner showcased and celebrated this rich, diverse pluralism. It interrogated and illustrated the many fascinating practices – modern, traditional and alternative – and the challenges and opportunities they present for individuals and for Indian society. Through exhibitions, music, media arts and live events across India, incurably curious audiences encountered a rich mix of art, science and the extraordinary in everyday life.
